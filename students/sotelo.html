                <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Dr. Luz D. Sotelo (she/they) is an Assistant Professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University working in acoustics, ultrasonics, NDE, and convergent manufacturing applied to remote environments. She is the Purdue lead on a prestigious NSF: Future Manufacturing Award to study sustainability and performance for in space manufacturing. Before joining Purdue, Dr. Sotelo was a post-doctoral research associate under an award from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NRC RAP) at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. She is also a recipient of graduate research awards from the National Science Foundation (NSF GRFP and NSF GRIP). She completed her Ph.D. in mechanical engineering and applied mechanics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where she worked with Prof. Joseph A. Turner and Prof. Michael P. Sealy in the creation of functionally architected materials with hybrid Additive Manufacturing (AM) and their nondestructive characterization using ultrasonics. Before arriving at UNL, Dr. Sotelo earned her B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, where she worked with Prof. Constantine Tarawneh to identify faulty mechanical components onboard based on their vibration and thermal signatures. She has also been involved and led multiple efforts to promote broader societal participation in STEM fields and is a recipient of national awards from Great Minds in STEM and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. Sotelo enjoys attending music performances and distance running (half, relay, and full marathons).</p>
